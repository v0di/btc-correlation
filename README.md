# Pearson correlation coefficients between alt-coins and the Bitcoin
This simple analysis done in python has the goal of calculating the distribution of the Pearson correlation coefficients between some of the alt-coins listed in Binance and the Bitcoin.
We are often told that all the other coins in the crypto market just follow Bitcoin. How accurate is this statement? In this simple and quick study in python, using the pandas and matplotlib libraries and the binance API, I show you how most of the alt-coins have been correlated with Bitcoin between Nov/2020 and Nov/2021.
